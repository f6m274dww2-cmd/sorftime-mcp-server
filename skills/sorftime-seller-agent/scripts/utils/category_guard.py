"""
China Small/Medium Seller Safe Sourcing — Category Risk Assessment & Advisory v3.0

ARCHITECTURE CHANGE (v3.0):
  The four-tier system is now an ADVISORY layer, not a blocking filter.
  Products are NEVER removed from results. Every product gets a risk level +
  a specific warning, surfaced AFTER output. The seller (or an independent
  review sub-agent) makes the final call — the tool informs, it does not censor.

Risk Levels (severity order):
  hard    — Hard risk (extremely high compliance barrier: food/supplements/medical/etc.)
  capital — Capital-Intensive risk (high inventory/returns/SKU complexity)
  ops     — Operations-Complex risk (certification/logistics/after-sales)
  trap    — Trap Signal (data anomaly/red ocean/suspected violation)
  safe    — Safe

Low Risk Advisory (non-blocking):
  Accessories, eyewear, pet supplies (non-food), basic kitchenware

False-positive mitigation (v3.0):
  - English keywords match on word boundaries (`\b...\b`) so "apple" the brand
    no longer fires on "apple slicer", "wear" no longer fires on "eyewear".
  - Context overrides downgrade known benign combinations:
      non-slip / anti-slip  -> NOT the apparel "slip" block
      SPF/UPF clothing      -> NOT "functional cosmetics"
      alcohol/disinfecting wipes & prep pads -> commodity cleaning, NOT beverage
      apple slicer/corer/peeler -> NOT the Apple brand
      watch band/strap/case -> NOT the jewelry "watch" block
      reusable/cotton face masks -> NOT regulated medical masks
