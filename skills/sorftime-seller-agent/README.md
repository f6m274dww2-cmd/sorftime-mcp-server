## 🆕 What's New (August 10, 2026)

- **🎯 v3.6.0 Instruction Priority — Obey the Seller**: Precise instructions execute **directly** (no routing, no methodology cards, no lens imposition) — ask for "product_search yoga mat sorted by sales, data only" and you get exactly that, unfiltered and unembellished. Ambiguous/exploratory requests still get the guided flow. The Closed-Loop workflow is now an **opt-in reference** (runs only via `/goal`/`/loop` or explicit request); daily queries never enter it.
- **🔇 Risk folding for pros**: `pro`/`factory`/`brand` profiles collapse the risk table to a footnote + one-line 🔴hard hints (`--show-risks` to expand); `newbie`/`grower` keep full warnings + safe-shortlist. Risk stays advisory — never blocks, never hides.
- **🛡️ v3.5.0 Advisory Risk Model** — The 4-tier risk system is now **advisory, not blocking**. Products are **never hidden**. Every result carries a risk badge (`🔴hard`/`🟡capital`/`🟠ops`/`⚠️trap`/`🟢safe`) with a specific warning, surfaced AFTER the results. The seller — or an independent review agent — makes the final call. This kills the false-positive blocking other tools suffer from: non-slip yoga mats are no longer "apparel", alcohol wipes are no longer "chemicals", microwave-safe containers are no longer "large appliances". Matches the skill's own "no hard thresholds, full-set ranking" principle.
- **🧐 Independent Shortlist Review** — New `scripts/review_shortlist.py` runs a deterministic second-opinion (category-relevance, margin sanity, IP/trademark, review anomalies, seasonal windows, compliance red flags) emitting `GO / CAUTION / NO-GO`. SKILL.md §1.1.5 adds a **mandatory post-selection review protocol**: Layer 1 script + Layer 2 fresh-context independent sub-agent red-team. `picker.py --json` wires discovery → review seamlessly.
- **🔀 mcp SDK 1.x/2.x dual-support** — The local bridge now runs natively on **both** mcp 1.x and 2.x (version-branched Server API, per the official 2.0 migration guide), plus a self-heal guard for unsupported SDK majors. No more "MCP 2.0 not yet supported" errors on any device — the skill self-repairs on first start.
- **🧪 Agent-level verified** — 3 independent agents exercised the skill end-to-end (beginner blue-ocean, pro competitor teardown, Walmart discovery), surfacing and fixing real doc-vs-code gaps (keyword-pollution false-GO, non-existent `--mode` refs, `product_reviews` pagination).
- **[Full changelog →](CHANGELOG.md)**

<details>
<summary>August 4, 2026 updates</summary>


- **🔄 Closed-Loop Product Selection Workflow** — The flagship end-to-end pipeline. Covers product discovery → supply chain → financial analysis → risk assessment → **7-member independent AI Seller Review Panel** → Go/No-Go deliverable → post-launch monitoring. Dual-path (HPI Product-First + Market-First with auto-routing). 6 business models, 7 platform adapters. One command: `/goal /sorftime-seller-agent Execute Closed-Loop Product Selection for yoga mats on Amazon US. Seller: beginner, $10000, private-label.` [Wiki](https://github.com/DannylydST/sorftime-seller-agent/wiki/Closed-Loop-Product-Selection-Workflow) · [Case Study](https://github.com/DannylydST/sorftime-seller-agent/wiki/Workflow-Case-Study)
- **🤖 7-Member Independent Seller Review Panel** — GO/CAUTION/NO-GO verdicts are no longer algorithmic thresholds. 7 independent AI sub-agents, each role-playing a different seller perspective (Peer, Mentor, Conservative, Opportunity, Platform Specialist, Financial Auditor), vote on every product with weighted scoring. Platform Specialist and Financial Auditor hold veto power. Panel may override algorithm. Validated: 20 rounds, 82.7% avg adoption.
- **💾 Data Persistence** — Every phase auto-saves to `${SORFTIME_OUTPUT_DIR}`. 9 files per run: raw API data, P&L calculations, panel votes, self-contained Markdown deliverable, copy-paste-ready monitoring command. Cross-platform.
- **📊 product_traffic_terms field trap documented** — The `exposure_position` field ("Organic"/"Ad"/"Ad,Organic") is the correct way to assess organic traffic. The non-existent `organic_searched_percentage` field returns false zeros. Now hard-coded into the skill's gotchas.

<details>
<summary>August 3, 2026 updates</summary>

- **🧠 HPI 5D Signal Scoring workflow** — Built-in skill workflow. Finds products with low ad dependency, low reviews, stable pricing, growing sales, and climbing BSR. 10 categories tested, 71 verified products.
- **⚡ 58 Loop & Goal templates** — [Wiki](https://github.com/DannylydST/sorftime-seller-agent/wiki/Loop-Goal-Command-Templates) with ready-to-run commands. HPI verified shortlist, full-market blind scan, category cross-mining.

```

## 🧠 What You Can Do

|     | Use Case | Example Prompt |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| 🔍 | **Amazon Product Research** | "Find blue ocean kitchen products under $30 on Amazon US for a beginner seller" |
| 💎 | **Hidden Profit Index** ⭐ | "Scan the yoga mat category — surface products with high hidden profit potential that other tools miss" |
| 🎯 | **Competitor Analysis (Reverse ASIN)** | "Break down ASIN B07H9PZDQW — monthly sales, traffic keywords, pricing history, FBA fees" |
| 🔑 | **Amazon Keyword Research** | "What are the best long-tail keywords for yoga mats? Show search volume and competition" |
| 💰 | **Amazon FBA Profit Calculator** | "Calculate FBA profit: $29.99 selling price, $8.50 unit cost, 1.2lb weight" |

## 🤔 Why This Exists

Amazon sellers spend **$29–$229/month** on marketplace research tools. You log into dashboards, click through menus, export CSV files, then manually analyze in spreadsheets.

**Worse — most tools only show you what you ask for.** Filter by minimum reviews, filter by minimum price, sort by sales. A product with 13 reviews, 106 units/month, healthy margins, and zero ad competition gets filtered out before you ever see it. That's the product you should be looking at.

**Sorftime Seller Agent replaces that workflow with conversation — and finds the products other tools hide from you.**

```
Before: Log in → navigate → click → export → analyze manually  (15–30 min)
After:  "Find blue ocean yoga mat products on Amazon US" → results in 20 seconds
```

## 🤖 Agent-Friendly by Design

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/agent-friendly-demo.gif" alt="Same skill running in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and OpenClaw — one skill, four AI agents, six marketplaces" width="100%">
</p>

**Not a Claude Code plugin. Not an API wrapper.** A self-contained MCP bridge + intelligence layer that any MCP-compatible AI agent can load and use immediately.

| Agent / IDE | Setup |
|-------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Auto-detected by `mcporter`, one-command install — under 3 min |
| **Codex (OpenAI)** | Import as MCP server — under 5 min |
| **Cursor** | MCP config auto-generated by `install.py` — under 3 min |
| **OpenClaw** | Native skill directory support — under 3 min |
| **Hermes / Pi / any MCP agent** | Standard `tools/list` → `tools/call` protocol — under 5 min |

**What makes it agent-agnostic:**

- **MCP-first architecture** — 97 tools, auto-synced with Sorftime server. Pure MCP protocol.
- **Zero agent-specific code** — No Claude-only prompts. No Cursor-only config.
- **Auto-detection** — `install.py` detects your environment and outputs the right config snippet.
- **Self-contained** — Ships with its own Python venv, bridge, cache, and schema store. Python 3.10+ is the only dependency.
- **Bilingual** — English and Chinese input, auto-routed to the right analysis pipeline.

## 💬 Example Conversations

### Hidden Profit Index (Sorftime exclusive ⭐)
> **You**: "Show me products quietly making money on Amazon US — the ones other tools miss."
>
> **Agent**: *[potential_product — Hidden Profit Index scan]*
> "Found a non-slip yoga mat: $29.99, 4.6 stars, **only 13 reviews, 106 units/month**. Near-zero ad competition. Price stable, category rank climbing. Every other tool filters this out because 'reviews < 50.' Hidden Profit Index: 13.44 — top of the category. Low barriers, healthy margins, real demand. The kind of product most sellers never see."

### Amazon product discovery (blue ocean)
> **You**: "Find blue ocean products in kitchen storage on Amazon US. Beginner seller, $5K budget."
>
> **Agent**: *[category scan + competition filter]*
> "5 opportunities with low brand concentration, <500 reviews on top listings, healthy margins. #1: Under-sink organizers — 15K monthly searches, only 3 competitors with >100 reviews, estimated margin 35–42%."

### Amazon competitor deep-dive (reverse ASIN)
> **You**: "Reverse ASIN B07H9PZDQW — traffic keywords, pricing strategy, sales trend."
>
> **Agent**: *[ProductDetail + TrafficTerms + CompetitorKeywords]*
> "Gaiam Yoga Block — 40K monthly sales, 4.7 stars, $18.99. Top traffic keywords: 'yoga block' (52K), 'yoga blocks 2 pack' (28K), 'cork yoga block' (15K). FBA fee: $12.82. Top competitor ASINs: B07XJ5YV8G, B09XMQ5J8W."

### Amazon FBA profitability
> **You**: "Sourcing yoga mats at $8.50. Selling at $29.99, 1.2lb. Worth it on Amazon FBA?"
>
> **Agent**: *[FBA fee estimation + profit calculation]*
> "Gross margin: 38%. Break-even: 9 units/day. Return rate sensitivity: profit stays positive up to 12% returns. Verdict: viable — proceed."

### Amazon keyword research
> **You**: "Keyword strategy for a new yoga mat listing on Amazon US."
>
> **Agent**: *[KeywordDetail + KeywordExtends + KeywordSearchResults]*
> "Top opportunities: 'extra thick yoga mat' (147K searches, low competition), 'non slip yoga mat' (98K), 'yoga mat with strap' (52K). Avoid 'yoga mat' (1.4M, saturated — Amazon Basics + Gaiam dominate)."

### Shopee category market analysis
> **You**: "Shopee Malaysia phone case market — Top 20 products, pricing bands, shop types."
>
> **Agent**: *[shopee_category_request]*
> "20 products, RM2.38–RM102.37. Ugreen Flagship Store leads with 3.5K monthly sales at RM13.90. 13 brands, all regular shops (no flagship in Top 20). 9/20 products under RM5 — low-end dominates."

### Cross-platform arbitrage (Walmart vs Amazon)
> **You**: "Find products selling 30%+ higher on Walmart than Amazon US."
>
> **Agent**: *[Cross-platform gap scan]*
> "3 products with significant gaps. 'Premium Yoga Block Set' — $34.99 Walmart vs $24.99 Amazon (40% premium). Only 3 Walmart sellers vs 12 on Amazon — low competition entry point."

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Dependencies

This skill requires **MCP SDK 1.x** (not 2.x — breaking changes). The `requirements.txt` locks to `mcp>=1.0.0,<2.0.0`.

```bash
# If you hit "MCP 2.x is not yet supported" or AttributeError on startup:
python3 scripts/install.py --upgrade

# This force-reinstalls all dependencies at the correct versions.
```

### Updating

```bash
git pull                        # Pull latest skill updates
python3 scripts/install.py      # Rebuild venv (if deps changed)
python3 scripts/healthcheck.py  # Verify everything works
```

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute...` | `python3 scripts/install.py --upgrade` |
| `MCP 2.x is not yet supported` | `python3 scripts/install.py --upgrade` |
| `ModuleNotFoundError: mcp` | Run `python3 scripts/install.py` |
| Connection test fails | Check MCP Key, network, firewall |
